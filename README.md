## Dataset Description 📝

The Stroke Prediction dataset includes health-related data points for individuals, along with a label indicating whether the person has experienced a stroke. This dataset is ideal for training and testing machine learning models aimed at predicting the likelihood of strokes.

### Columns in the Dataset 📋

1. **id**: Unique identifier for each individual.
2. **gender**: Gender of the individual.
3. **age**: Age of the individual.
4. **hypertension**: 0 if the individual does not have hypertension, 1 if the individual has hypertension.
5. **heart_disease**: 0 if the individual does not have any heart diseases, 1 if the individual has a heart disease.
6. **ever_married**: "No" or "Yes" indicating whether the individual was ever married.
7. **work_type**: Type of occupation (e.g., children, Govt_job, Never_worked, Private, Self-employed).
8. **Residence_type**: Type of residence (Rural or Urban).
9. **avg_glucose_level**: Average glucose level in the blood.
10. **bmi**: Body mass index.
11. **smoking_status**: Smoking status of the individual (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, unknown).
12. **stroke**: 1 if the individual had a stroke, 0 if not.

## Usage Examples 💡

Here are a few examples of how you can use this dataset:

- **Predictive Modeling**: Train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual experiencing a stroke based on their health data.
- **Health Analysis**: Analyze the relationships between different health parameters and the occurrence of strokes.
- **Risk Factor Identification**: Identify key risk factors associated with strokes by analyzing the dataset.
